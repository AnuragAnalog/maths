# MATHS

This repo contains some basic maths solving programs.

1. factorial.c
    This program takes an integer as an input and computes the factorial for it and the limit for n is 30.
2. permu.c
    This program takes two integers as inputs and computes the number of permutations and the limit for each number is 30.
3. combi.c
    This program takes two integers as inputs and computes the number of combinations and the limit for each number is 30.
4. quadratic.c
    This program takes the co-efficients of the quadratic equation as input computes the roots even if they are complex and does the computation for a complex-valued function.

There are some programs for performing some basic arithmetic on the matrices, transpose of a matrix, programs for finding det and inverse for 3x3 matrices, program for solving 3 Non-homogenous equations using cramer's rule, matrix inversion method.

**playing-with-numbers**

    In this directory, there are some special programs which says tells about the special properties of a given input number, like automorphic, neon, lab..etc., for the terminology see the documentation in the code.
